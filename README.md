# Local-Bus-Network

A public transport system must accommodate a very large number of individual trips. It’s not 
possible to provide direct public transport routes to meet all requirements But it’s possible to 
go a long way towards achieving this by providing a network of routes , so that passengers 
can make complex journeys by using a combination of routes. Many transport systems consist 
of routes planned in isolation rather than as parts of coordinated networks. This is usually 
unsatisfactory for meeting the requirements of a significant proportion of travellers. Poor 
route planning may result in poor route coverage, an excessive requirement for interchange 
between routes, and irregular frequencies.
